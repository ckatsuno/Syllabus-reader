# beeorganized.tech

beeorganized.tech is a website that allows users to automatically convert events in files(like your syllabus!) to an event on your google calendar! Just drop in the file you want to parse, and our algorithm will automatically detect the event to add! Users will then be given the option to confirm the addition to the calendar, or make edits to it!
